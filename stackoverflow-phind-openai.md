# question: 
hi there :)
In docker I'm trying to connect aka make requests between 2 containers. One is a golang server which listens to port 8080 and exposes it via a dockerfile. The other is a cloudflare tunnel container. 
My local device aka laptop reaches the golang server, but I cant make requests from one container to the other. DNS resolution is working, but the server gives a connection refused immediatly. Can you help me?

To resolve the issue of not being able to make requests from one Docker container to another, especially when one container is a Golang server listening on port 8080 and the other is a Cloudflare Tunnel container, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Port Mapping**: First, ensure that both containers are correctly mapped to expose the necessary ports. For the Golang server, you need to map its internal port 8080 to a port on the host machine. Similarly, for the Cloudflare Tunnel container, ensure it's configured to listen on the correct port and that this port is exposed and mapped appropriately.

2. **Use Container Names for Inter-Container Communication**: When containers are part of the same Docker network, they can communicate with each other using their container names instead of IP addresses. Ensure both containers are on the same Docker network. You can create a custom network and attach both containers to it using the `--network` option when running them.

3. **Check Firewall Rules**: Sometimes, firewall rules within the containers or on the host machine might block communication between containers. Ensure that there are no such rules preventing the Golang server from receiving connections from the Cloudflare Tunnel container.

4. **Inspect Logs**: Check the logs of both containers for any error messages or indications of why the connection might be refused. Use `docker logs <container_name>` to view the logs.

5. **Verify Network Configuration**: Since you mentioned DNS resolution works but the connection is immediately refused, it's possible that the network configuration inside the containers does not support the expected type of traffic. Verify that the network interfaces inside the containers are correctly configured to handle the traffic intended for the Golang server.

Here's an example of how you might run your containers, assuming you're using Docker Compose for simplicity:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  golang-server:
    build:.
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    networks:
      - app-network

  cloudflare-tunnel:
    image: cloudflared/cloudflared
    # Configure your Cloudflare Tunnel settings here
    networks:
      - app-network

networks:
  app-network:
```

This setup assumes you have a Dockerfile for building your Golang server and that you're using `cloudflared/cloudflared` as the Cloudflare Tunnel container. Adjust the configurations according to your actual setup.

If after following these steps you still face issues, consider providing more details about your Dockerfile, how you're starting your containers, and any relevant logs or error messages.

Of course, I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot this! It sounds like you're encountering connectivity issues between your Golang server container and your Cloudflare tunnel container within Docker. Here are a few things to check:

1. **Networking**: Ensure that both containers are on the same Docker network. By default, containers within the same Docker network can communicate with each other using their container names as hostnames.

2. **Firewall Rules**: Check if there are any firewall rules or network policies blocking traffic between the containers. Docker typically sets up permissive firewall rules within the Docker network, but it's worth double-checking.

3. **Port Mapping**: Confirm that you've correctly mapped the ports when running the containers. If the Golang server is listening on port 8080 inside the container, make sure you're exposing that port and mapping it to a port on your host machine.

4. **Container Configuration**: Verify that the Golang server container is actually listening on the correct interface and port. Sometimes misconfigurations can cause the server to listen on localhost only, which would prevent other containers from accessing it.

5. **Container Health**: Check if both containers are healthy and running without any errors. You can use `docker ps` to verify their status.

6. **Container Logs**: If the Golang server is immediately refusing connections, check its logs for any error messages that might indicate why it's refusing connections. Similarly, check the logs of the Cloudflare tunnel container to see if it's encountering any issues.

If you've already checked these points and are still facing issues, let me know, and we can dive deeper into troubleshooting!

Thanks for providing the detailed information! From what you've shared, it seems that both containers are on the same Docker network (`cf-tunnel`), which is good. 

Given that your Golang server container is listening on port 8080, and you've exposed that port in the Dockerfile (`EXPOSE 8080`), and you've mapped it to port 80 on your host machine (`- 80:8080`), it looks like your setup should allow incoming connections on port 80 to reach your Golang server container on port 8080.

However, there could be a couple of potential issues:

1. **Binding Address**: In your `main.go` file, you're currently binding your server to listen on all available network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`). This should theoretically allow connections from any source. 

2. **Health Check Path**: Your health check endpoint seems to be defined with an incorrect HTTP method and path. It should be `GET /health`, not `"GET /health"`. This might not be directly related to the connection issue, but it's worth correcting.

Since you're getting an immediate "connection refused" error, it suggests that the request isn't even reaching your Golang server. Here are a few steps to further diagnose the issue:

1. **Check Logs**: Look at the logs of your Golang server container to see if there are any errors being reported when it starts up or when it receives a request.

2. **Verify Connectivity**: You mentioned DNS resolution is working. Just to double-check, you can try running `curl` or `wget` commands from within the Cloudflare tunnel container to see if it can reach the Golang server container. For example:
   
   ```bash
   docker exec -it tunnel curl http://image_proxy:8080/health
   ```

3. **Firewall Rules**: Ensure that there are no firewall rules on your host machine or network that might be blocking incoming connections on port 80.

Let's try these steps and see if we can pinpoint the issue further. If you discover any additional information or errors, please let me know!

Based on the provided `main.go`, `Dockerfile`, and Docker Compose configuration, your setup seems mostly correct for allowing inter-container communication between your Golang server and the Cloudflare Tunnel container. However, since you're experiencing a "connection refused" error when attempting to make requests from one container to another, let's address potential causes and solutions:

### 1. Correct Port Exposure and Binding

Your Dockerfile correctly uses `EXPOSE 8080` to indicate that the container listens on port 8080. This is good practice for documentation purposes, but remember, `EXPOSE` does not automatically publish the port. Your Docker Compose file maps port 80 on the host to port 8080 on the container (`ports: - 80:8080`), which should allow external access to your Golang server. Ensure that the Cloudflare Tunnel container is configured to route traffic to this exposed port.

### 2. Networking Configuration

Both containers are attached to the `cf-tunnel` network, which is good for enabling direct communication between them. The `docker network inspect cf-tunnel` output shows that both containers (`image_proxy` and `tunnel`) are assigned IP addresses within the same subnet, indicating they are on the same network. This setup should theoretically allow them to communicate using their container names as hostnames.

### 3. Health Endpoint Issue

There's a small typo in your `main.go` file where you define a handler for `/health`. You've written `mux.HandleFunc("GET /health",...)`, but it should be `mux.HandleFunc("/health",...)`. This could potentially cause issues if you're relying on health checks to verify connectivity.

### 4. Debugging Steps

- **Logs**: Check the logs of both containers for any errors or warnings that might indicate why the connection is being refused. Use `docker logs <container_name>` for each container.
- **Firewall/Antivirus**: Ensure that any firewall or antivirus software running on your host machine isn't blocking the connection between containers.
- **Cloudflare Tunnel Configuration**: Double-check the Cloudflare Tunnel configuration to ensure it's correctly routing traffic to your Golang server. Misconfiguration here could lead to the connection being refused.

### 5. Testing Connectivity

To test connectivity between containers, you can execute a simple HTTP request from one container to the other using `curl` or a similar tool. For example, from the Cloudflare Tunnel container, you could try accessing `http://image_proxy:8080/health` (assuming `image_proxy` is the name of your Golang server container).

### Conclusion

Given the information provided, your setup appears to be correctly configured for inter-container communication. The "connection refused" error suggests a networking issue, possibly related to how the Cloudflare Tunnel routes traffic or a misconfiguration in the Golang server's handling of incoming requests. Reviewing the logs and ensuring the Cloudflare Tunnel is correctly configured to route traffic to your Golang server's exposed port are good next steps.

solution was just to use ... 
- ports: 
  - 8080:8080

- 80:8080 didnt work.

- isn't port 80
