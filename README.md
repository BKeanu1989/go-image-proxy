## Known Issues


---
    - Implement a proxy layer in Golang.
    - Modify the proxy code to intercept the actual response data and return the resized data.
    - Process or save the resized image in S3 parallely without blocking the response.


```tip
The imgproxy URL in this example is not signed but signing URLs is especially important when using encrypted source URLs to prevent a padding oracle attack.
```
